# localsurvey
An open-source and customizable local survey service!
Certainly! Below is an extended version of the README, including a guide on setting up a configuration file (`config.js`) and a basic guide on setting up a server using Node.js and Express.js.

## Installation

1. Clone the project:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd project-name
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start the application.

## User Guide

1. Fill out the survey form.
2. Progress through each stage by clicking the "Next" button.
3. If needed, use the "Previous" button to go back.
4. After completing the form, click the "Submit Survey" button to send the data to the server.

## Configuring the Application

To customize the survey form and stages, you can edit the `config.js` file. Follow these steps:

1. Open the `config.js` file in a text editor.

2. Update the `config` object with your desired configurations. You can customize form fields, stages, themes, and other settings.

   ```javascript
   const config = {
       // Your configuration settings go here
   };

   export default config;
   ```

## Setting Up a Server

This application can be extended to store survey data on a server. To set up a basic server, you can use Node.js and Express.js. Follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Create a new file named `server.js` in the project directory.

3. Install Express.js using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

4. Open `server.js` and set up a basic server:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
   const app = express();
   const port = 3000;

   // Middleware to parse JSON
   app.use(bodyParser.json());
   app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

   // Your server logic goes here

   app.listen(port, () => {
       console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
   });
   ```

5. Extend the server logic to handle form submissions, store data, etc., based on your requirements.
